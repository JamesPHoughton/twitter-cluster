It then constructs a set of weighted and unweighted network structures based upon co-citation of hashtags within a tweet. The network diagrams are interpreted to have a set of clusters within them which represent 'conversations' that are happening in the pool of twitter messages. We track similarity between clusters from day to day to investigate how conversations develop.\n",
