The igraph library
------------------

igraph is a library for creating and manipulating graphs. 
It is intended to be as powerful (ie. fast) as possible to enable the
analysis of large graphs. 

It was started as an additional package to the GNU R system, but most
of its functions can also be used as a separate library.

See the additional HTML files for installation instructions, 
and documentation.
