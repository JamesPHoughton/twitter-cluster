This is the readme file for the endfloat package v2.5

This readme was modified on October 2, 1997 but without
updated endfloat itself, instead to fix errors in this file
and in endfloat.ins

It was again modified on March 31, 2006, by Frank K\"uster
<frank@kuesterei.ch> to indicate the license clarification (see below).

It was again modified on December 4, 2011, by Axel Sommerfeldt
<axel.sommerfeldt@f-m.fm> to reflect the changes introduced
with version 2.5 of the endfloat package.

Endfloat is a LaTeX package.  Versions 2.1 and above require
LaTeX2e.

Accompanying files should be:

	README				This file
	endfloat.dtx			Docstrip archive  (essential)
	endfloat.ins			(La)TeX batch file (if you
					    don't know what it is
					    then you DO need it)

============================================================
Overview:
  the package places figures and tables at the end of the document,
  as often requested by journals for non-camera ready submission.

========================================================
Installation:

Run

  latex endfloat.ins

This will produce three files, endfloat.sty, endfloat.drv and efxmpl.cfg .
You can run LaTeX on endfloat.drv for the documentation.
  
You should copy the file endfloat.sty to where you keep
your (La)TeX inputs.  You should read the documentation to find out
more about the example configuration file, efxmpl.cfg.

To produce the documentation, run LaTeX on endfloat.drv (or endfloat.dtx)
a couple of times, and then use the makeindex program (which might be
called makeindx on your system) to generate the index

 makeindex -g -s gind.ist endfloat

Then run LaTeX (at least) two more times to get the index in the table
of contents.

=========================================================
Major changes in version 2.5 since 2.4:
  New commands \DeclareDelayedFloat, \DeclareDelayedFloatFlavor,
  and \SetupDelayedFloat added.
  New package options `tablesonly' and `figuresonly' added.

Major changes in version 2.4 since 2.3:
  Configuration file (with example of getting sidewaystable to work),
  Many new hooks for more user control.  Internal changes.

Major changes in version 2.3 and 2.2 since 2.1:
  Documentation and many internal changes.
  Added options for suppressing "Tables" and "Figures" section heads, for
  switching order of tables and figures.  Use of package options
  generally.

Obtaining endfloat:  The necessary files are kept on the Comprehensive
TeX Archive Network (CTAN).  Current CTAN sites are ftp.tex.ac.uk,
ftp.shsu.edu, and ftp.dante.de.  They are also mirrored at other locations.
Once on CTAN, type the command "quote site index endfloat" to
find where endfloat lives.  It is probably in
macros/latex/contrib/supported/endfloat .
Get the whole directory.
